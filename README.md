# WPF Diary

Hello everyone!

This is a WPF Diary app that will use a local encrypted database./
This app will be rather straight forward, The UI will include a login page,
a main page in which the user can enter a diary entree, a second page in which the user can
search for entries using keywords and explicit queries, and a 3rd page that will allow to remove entries by ID, and a final page with info about the app.

### Other information

* The app will use the .Net framework version 4.7.2 and primarily target 64bit machines.
* Encryption will be AES-256 bit.
* The app will be coded with scaleability in mind.

### Notes

If anyone would like to help it is more than welcome, if you have suggestions I would love to hear them.

### Future features (Not available in current release)

* Allow multiple users, with option to delete entire user data.
